    "When you're at the ear doctor, she will increase the intensity of a tone until you can hear it. Until you can detect it. She does this to measure how sensitive your hearing is. Imagine you are a radiologist and have to decide whether on an x-ray there is a tumor present or not. This is also a detection task. You have to detect the tumor. We will be simulating this last task with our stimuli but what we will learn is applicable more generally to all detection tasks. "

    "Instead of detecting a tumor, in our task you have to detect the letter *A* in a noisy image. Running the code in the next cell will generate a plot. In it you see a noisy image *without* the letter *A* on the left. We call this the noise-only condition. On the right you see a noisy image *with* the letter *A*. This is the signal-plus-noise condition. "

    "The one parameter of the function `imshow_stimuli` allows you to change the intensity of the stimulus. Play with it! When it is at zero there is no signal (just like on the left). The *A* is clearly visible with the intensity being at `125`. You can probably still kinda see the *A* when you set the parameter to `50`. You should know you're looking at grayscale images where `0` is black and `255` is white. The noise-only pixels have a mean of `127`, i.e. gray, and the standard deviation of the noise was set to `25`. The pixels of the *A* have a mean of `127` plus the intensity that you've set and the same standard deviation. "

    "## Some Cautionary Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we want to answer is: How well can you detect the *A*. Or more generally, how can we measure your sensitivity in any detection task? In a second step, which we will not address here, we could then compare your sensitivity to everyone else's in the class to find out who's the best *A*-detector (or the best radiologist or who has a hearing problem). The reason why we won't attempt a comparison is that you're all doing this task on different computers and with different monitors. Some monitors might be better than other monitors and allow for a higher contrast. Also your detection performance will depend on the luminance of the monitor and the lighting in your room. Hence, if we measure your performance on the *A*-detection task we're really measuring your performance *on your setup*. Therefore, any comparison is not meaningful psychologically (but note that some radiologists might also have better setups than other radiologists and we might therefore also care about the setup in some applications). Given that we expect the lighting in your room to also play a role you should try to keep all conditions as constant as possible, e.g. by sitting at the same desk and by closing the curtains and switching off all lights. Also make sure that you're well rested and able to concentrate while you're doing the experiments. We want to measure your best possible performance and not you're performance when you're tired or worn out. Psychological data are already noisy enough as they are, we don't want to introduce additional, unnecessary variability. With these comments out of the way. How do we measure sensitivity?"
